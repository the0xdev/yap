A simple paste bin built with [[https://www.djangoproject.com/][Django]].
** Setup
This Project works with [[https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/][pipenv]] to manage python dependencies so make sure that
you have it installed. After you do that pipenv will automatically install all
the dependencies that the project needs.
#+begin_src sh
  pipenv install
#+end_src
Then you should enter the virtual environment of the project and create the
super user for the application.
#+begin_src sh
  pipenv shell
  python manage.py createsuperuser
#+end_src
This should be everything that you need for the basic setup. you can quickly
deploy a development server while in the virtual environment to make sure
everything works.
#+begin_src sh
  pipenv shell
  python manage.py createsuperuser
#+end_src
Or deploy it like any other Django app. with the documentation [[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/howto/deployment/][here]]
